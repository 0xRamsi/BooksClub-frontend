## Frontend of an example project.

This is an example project, which I used to learn Scala. It was inspired by Tasks that I got for coding interviews.
It demonstrated basic concepts, in the backend. For the frontend I didn't learn much yet, but I'm planning to
integerate GraphQL.

## How to run it

Note that this will only run the frontend part.

```
git clone https://github.com/0xRamsi/BooksClub-frontend.git
cd frontend
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

Then visit http://localhost:8080. A backend should be available at http://localhost:8081.
